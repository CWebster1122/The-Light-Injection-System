Excel files for temperature correction

Just a few notes:
This temperature data was written to an sd card inside our temperature probe in the UTKL Austin laboratory. The file is saved as an excel .XLS file automatically.
Though for some reason, the format of which data was written changed at a certain point. 
So the least elegant but fastest way to handle this, was to just delete the unnecessary data with the other format before saving as a txt file (I made sure to never delete it from the sd though.

* Make sure to save the excel file as a tab delimited text file to ensure compatibiliy with "temp_write.py" * 	"tempya.txt" is the tab delimited file in this case

A couple more suggestions:
If you end up using this probe or one like it, I would suggest downloading the excel file and directly use excel to change it and save.
Sometimes the file does not transfer well to Google Sheets and will make your life more difficult. Also strange OS peculuarities kick in with what the file type is which complicates things.
